# Introducing Glow: Beautiful, pixel-perfect Markdown code blocks

[author]

Today we're launching *Glow* — a new take on syntax highlighting:

[media]
  small: /img/glow-og.png
  large: /img/glow-og-big.png
  class: wide hero-image
  href: /glow-demo/
  caption: 30+ languages colored. Click the image for a standalone view.


*Glow is different*: Instead of attempting to understand language internals, Glow focuses solely on aesthetics — and how your code looks.

*Glow is simple:* Glow makes all languages work with your brand colors by adjusting just a handful of CSS variables.

*Glow is microscale*. Glow is orders of magnitude smaller than the mainstream alternatives. We're talking [5K](//pkg-size.dev/nue-glow) instead of [5M](//pkg-size.dev/shiki). It's by far the smallest implementation available.

## Coloring voodoo
Be it *Haskell*, *TypeScript*, or *Zig*. *React*, *Vue* or *Svelte*. Whatever Turing-free *Markdown* artifact is mixed with another tightly coupled language-of-the-year oddity. And they will all glow:

[media]
  small: /img/glow-light.png
  large: /img/glow-light-big.png
  href: /glow-demo/light.html
  class: wider light-skins
  caption: All the 30+ languages in light mode

Contrast this to grammar-aware highlighters like *Shiki*, where it's a large programming effort to add a new language to the mix. For example, the [golang.json][go] grammar file has 2700 lines, and [javascript.json][js] is a whopping 6000-line configuration file.

[js]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/grammars/javascript.json

[go]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/grammars/go.json


## Easy brand coloring
If you look at the most recognizable brands on the internet, you'll notice that 80% of them are based on a single [brand color](//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-colors). It is often coupled with a secondary color and a complementary accent color. This is exactly how Glow works. You can make the code blocks compatible with your brand just by adjusting a handful of CSS variables:

[code.is-dark wrapper="shiny"]
  /* brand-aware CSS variables*/
  [glow] {
    --glow-primary-color: #7dd3fc;
    --glow-secondary-color: #4f72b6;
    --glow-accent-color: #419fff;
  }


It's a no-brainer to create new themes, both light and dark, after which all languages will automatically adapt your brand colors. No missing color tokens, no surprises.

Contrast this to grammar-aware theming systems, like Shiki and *Prism*, where a single theme can have hundreds of color variables. [Monokai theme][monokai], for example, has 140 color variables, and [Material theme][material] has a whopping 296 variables. It's a huge development effort to build a new theme that works reliably across languages.

[monokai]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-themes/themes/monokai.json

[material]: //github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-themes/themes/material-theme.json


## Unlimited possibilities
Glow's unique, [classless design system](/docs/concepts/syntax-highlighting.html#system) gives you line numbers, selections, error highlights, insertions, deletions, and much much more.

[code.is-dark.browser-like wrapper="shiny sky" numbered="true"]
  <script>
    // imports
    import { longpress } from './longpress.js';

    let pressed = false;
    ••bet glow_market = 9999_99++••;
  </script>

  <label>
    <input type=range •bind:value={duration}• max={2000} step={100}>
    {duration}ms
  </label>

  <button use:longpress={duration}
  -  on:mousedown="{() => pressed = true}"
  +  on:longpress="{() => pressed = true}">Press me</button>

  <!-- condition -->
  {#if pressed}
    <p>••Yoou•• pressed and held for {duration}ms</p>
  {/if}

  <style>
    /* button style */
    [role="button"], •button• {
      background-color: var(--main-color);
      color: #899;
    }
  </style>

And when I say "unlimited", it means that:

[code language="md" numbered="true" wrapper="live-code"]
  # There's something about Lightning CSS
  Writing future CSS today has been a massive
  •productivity boost.• You'll get nesting, `color-mix()`,
  variables, and whatnot. Natively, today.

## Glow + Nue = Next level
[Nue](/blog/introducing-nuemark/) is a content-first web development framework. As of today, it has built-in support for Glow. You can do things like this inside your markdown content:


[codeblocks.shiny.codeblocks captions="Content *YAML* | Styling *CSS*"]
  # View metadata
  members:
    title: Members
    columns: [Source, Joined]
    sorting:
      created: Join date
      cc: Location
      email: Email

  customers:
    title: Customers
    columns: [Plan, Subscribed]
    sorting:
      created: Date subscribed
      card: Card type

  ---
  /* Tab styling */
  [role=tablist] {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .7);
    background-size: 3.5em;
    padding: .7em 1.3em 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;

    a {
      color: #fff9;
      padding: .2em 1em .4em;
      font-size: 90%;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
  }

Or things like this:


[codetabs.is-dark "HTML | CSS | Web Component" wrapper="shiny waves" numbered="1"]
  <dialog>
    <!-- "is" attribute for binding to web component -->
    <form action="/backend/leads" is="post-component">
      <header>
        <h2>{ title }</h2>
      </header>

      <label>
        <h3>Username</h3>
        <input name="username">
      </label>
      <label>
        <h3>Password</h3>
        <input name="password" type="password">
      </label>

      <footer>
        <button class="primary">Sign in</button>
      </footer>
    </form>
  </dialog>
  ---
  dialog {
    background-color: #0004;
    box-shadow: 0 0 2em #9cc;
    border-radius: 1em
  }

  label {
    display: block;
    margin-bottom: 1em
    input { width: 100% }
  }

  footer {
    margin-top: 1em;
    button { width: 100%; }
  }
  ---
  // Generic Web Component for sending data
  class HTXPost extends HTMLElement {
    constructor(options) {
      super()
      const endpoint = this.getAttribute('action')
      const formData = new FormData(this)

      this.onsubmit = (e) => {
        const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
          headers: { AccessKey: options.access_key },
          method: 'POST'
        })
      }
    }
  }

  customElements.define('htx-post', HTXPost, {
    extends: 'form'
  })


With the release of Glow, the core pieces of the [Perfect Web Framework](/blog/perfect-web-framework/) are now ready and the development focus can now shift to a design system and templates:

## Get started with Glow
You can try Glow either as a standalone library or together with the Nue framework.

#### Standalone library
Install [nue-glow](//github.com/nuejs/nue/tree/master/packages/glow) with npm, pnpm, or bun:

``` sh
npm i nue-glow
```

And follow the [Glow documentation](/docs//concepts/syntax-highlighting.html)

#### With Nue

Nue has built-in support for Glow in markdown fenced code blocks and it offers [three new tags](/reference/nuemark-tags.html#code): `[code]`, `[codeblocks]`, and `[codetabs]` for content creators.

You try out the tags as follows:

``` sh
# Install Bun (if not done yet)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install website generator (Nuemark playground)
bun install nuekit --global

# Start a Nue project with a Glow-powered template
bun create nue@latest
```

Choose *"Simple blog"* on the last step and you can enjoy goodies content hot-reloading when the code blocks are edited:
